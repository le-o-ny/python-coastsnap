# CoastSnap_Python_Jupyter_Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks present the critical functionality in CoastSnap's MATLAB code and the equivalent functionality using Python.

Additional set up for MATLAB notebooks:
- To use MATLAB in Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter-MATLAB must be installed using steps described here: https://am111.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jmatlab_install.html

- At the top of each notebook, change the directory in the addpath() function to match the location of the file 'MATLAB Notebooks' to where you have downloaded it to on you machine.
