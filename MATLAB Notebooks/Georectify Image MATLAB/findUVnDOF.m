%
% computes the distorted UV coordinates that correspond to a set of xyz
% points where the extrinsic parameters are specified by beta
% There are numerous options for beta, depending on what is known or not 
% known.  xyz is assumed to be an Nx3 list of world coordinates
% beta options
%   length 6 (6 dof)    - [xCam yCam zCam azimuth tilt roll]
%   length 5 (5 dof)    - [xCam yCam zCam azimuth tilt]
%   length 3 (3 dof)    - [azimuth tilt roll]
%   length 2 (2 dof)    - [azimuth tilt]
%
% When a beta is less than 6, the missing parameters are assumed to be
% passed as global variables in a structure globs.lcp, .knownFlags and 
% .knowns where the knowns are listed in their natural order.  
% This structure is passed as an optional third argument in the
% function call normally.  However, if this routine is called as the forward 
% model in nlinfit, only two input arguments are allowed.  In that case,
% the globally-passed version, g2, is used to fill in these variables.
% If beta is a 1x6 vector, the global information is still needed for the
% lcp structure.
%
%  NOTE - this returns DISTORTED COORDINATES.  THEY ARE ALSO RETURNED AS A
%  COLUMN VECTOR of U(:); V(:) for use with nlinfit!!
